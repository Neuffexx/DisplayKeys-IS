## The first release of the DisplayKeys Image Splitter.
A tool specifically made for my own personal need/want of adding images across my Mountain DisplayPad buttons.
Without having to open up any photo editor and manually trial and error:
 1. cut up images 
 2. assign them to the DisplayPad to find out if they work.

This application will 'not' automate, but at the very least speed up the process of the first step significantly by only having to enter a few values.
Maybe it will even do the second step for you in the future, if I figure out how.

## Whats to come?
Well currently I have planned to try and add a few things, some big some small, both workload wise and also in terms of noticeability / usability.

- ### Functionality
  - **Create _GIF_ support** 
    (The Mountain DisplayPad supports it so might as well give the option)
  - **Directly creating a _Mountain BaseCamp_ integration**
    (This would allow me for example, to create a button that would directly assign the images to the buttons, rather than make you do it yourself)
- ### QoL:
  - **Saving / Loading **Presets**** 
    (So that you don't have to re-enter all the values if you already know what you will need in the future)
  - **Adding a preview screen in the window of _Cuts_ / _Cropping_**
    (no longer would anyone need to guess 'what will the result look like?')
  - **Clean up the UI**
    (I would like it to be a bit easier/faster to use, especially after introducing some of the mentioned changes)
- ### Under the hood
  - **Improve Image Splitting Logic** 
    (To simply make you get the results you want without having to sacrifice the image)
  - **Figure out a way to add information to the .exe file**
    (Stuff like version, copy right, description, etc. that you can find when right-clicking the exe > Properties > details)
