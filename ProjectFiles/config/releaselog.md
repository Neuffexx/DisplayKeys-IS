## Previewer Patch + UI Colour Change
Just a small quick fix for the Previewer, I noticed that it didnt include special rules for the Outlier Image-Cells like the actual cropping does.
Also changed the colours of the UI to make it more comfortable to use at night/in the dark.


### Changes:
- Fixed the Previewer
  > Note that the previewer is just that, a previewer.  
  > Its not 100% Accurate at the moment, and will not affect the final results.
- Changed Colour scheme of UI
   - _If someone has any suggestions for a good cholour scheme let me know over on discord. @Neuffexx_
