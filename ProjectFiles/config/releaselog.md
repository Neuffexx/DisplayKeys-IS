## Look at allll those pixels... beforehand!
I would say this is another small update, and honestly, feature wise it is.  
But this took me quite some time to do, at some point I said 'screw it' threw out the ENTIRE existing interface, and started over.  
I restructured everything to make my future life easier, and make it more readable for myself (and potentially others).

Now whats new, well simply said a way to see your changes before you actually split the image.  
May not seem major, but that does significantly improve how fast you can adjust your image to the desired cuts,
so that it fits as well as possible onto your DisplayPad.


### Changes:
- Added Previewer (cant miss it)
   - Whenever you want to you can press the 'Update Preview' button beneath the Preview Window.  
     (Ok that one you might miss)
   - When you press it, it will recalculate based on your inputs and show you:
      - How/where it would split your image into image-cells
      - What of the remaining image-cells will be cropped to create a square aspect ratio  
        (Remember the Mountain DisplayPad only supports 'square' images)
> For now you need to press the button and manually update the preveiw every time you make changes.  
> Dont worry this will be automated in the future.
