## GIF Support
A small but functional update, was going to wait a bit longer to add more to the tool before creating another release.
But this felt 'core' enough of a needed functionality that I wanted to get it out there as soon as possible.

### Changes:
- Added Support for .gif files
   - Now when an image or gif is selected it will automatically determine which type it is
   - supported formats are: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .gif
- Also added file information to the .exe (description, version, copyright, etc.)
