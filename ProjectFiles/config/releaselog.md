## Previewer Offset and Presets
_Just wanted to quickly say that the reason it took so long for an update lies between holidays,  
being sick, work, and just taking time for myself. Turned a 1-2 week job into two months._

---

#### So the two highlights of this release are:

1. ) We all had that one moment where splitting an Image to fit onto your Display Key Pad just baaaarely  
has some details `cut`/`cropped`/`lost` in the process. _WELL NO MORE!_  
Now you can click-drag your image in the previewer and move it to your desired position, and it will  
split it with that offset.

2. ) Remember that one website you download all your backgrounds from and keep on getting back too?  
Yeah, well you no longer need to remember the exact values you had used in the past to make it work.  
Now you can save any of your favorite combos as Presets. So you, just like me, can be even more lazy.  
You can `import` and `export` them.
> If you want to SAVE any of the presets, you NEED to EXPORT them. Currently, nothing is stored in the  
> application itself. Import them the next time you launch the application.  
> (Though do be warned they overwrite any existing ones)


### Changes:
#### Highlights:
- Previewer Offset
  - Click-Drag the image to offset your image (applies to final result)
  - A reset button has been added beneath the previewer to reset the position, just in case :)
  >   Still want to note that the previewer is just that, a previewer.  
  >   Its not 100% Accurate!
- Presets
   - In the Menu Bar `File>Presets` you can find:
     - Load Presets File  
       (aka. Import)
     - Save Presets  
       (aka. Export)
     - Delete Current Presets  
       (Deletes ALL presets currently loaded)
   - In Splitting Parameters now has:
     - A new Dropdown menu to Select one of the existing Presets
     - 3 new buttons to 'Add', 'Edit', 'Delete' the `currently selected` Preset

#### Extras:
- Previewer Auto-Updates now  
  (When changing any of the inputs the Previewer will automatically reflect the changes)
- Drag n Drop functionality has been added for Textboxes/Spinboxes
  - It will show either green/red based on whether it is of the expected data type
- Menu Bar has been added to the top of the Window for quick accessing some features 
  (Doesn't have much yet there but the groundwork is there so there will be more in the future)
- Added Pop-Up Windows for main interactions of application  
  (i.e. Confirmations, Warnings, Errors, Preset Adding/Editing, etc.)

> P.S. I will probably take some time after this release to work on the documentation rather than work on  
> new stuff, as I will be able to do this on the go and just get it initially out there.
