....


### Changes:
- Fixed the Previewer, now includes logic for Outlier Image-Cells
  > Note that the previewer is just that, a previewer.

- Added a bit of colour to the interface, mainly for the sake of my own eyes at late nights of working on it.
   - If someone has any suggestions for a good cholour scheme let me know over on discord.
