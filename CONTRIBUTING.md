# Contributing to DisplayKeys-IS
Would love to have your input and feedback! So I want to make contributing as easy as possible.
Here ill talk about how you can: 

- Contribute to the project either via a fix or feature
- Reporting a bug
- Suggest new functionalities/features
- Discussing the current state of the code


> ### Im making this purely using GitHub
> To host the code, track issues / feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

##  Contribute to the project
Any and all Changes for the final versions must be proposed through Pull Requests.

- How to actually Contribute

> 0. Contact me, let me know your interested on working on something, I will not be merging/accepting any unannounced pull requests!
> Either on here, or via Discord @Neuffexx

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Each new branch should address a specific issue to keep changes trackable.  
   * Ensure that `no one is assigned` to the Issue you are intending to take up first.  
   * Then make sure to `assign the issue to yourself` if its something you are working on so that other!
3. Once ready, create the pull request.  
4. Ensure the test Actions succeed!


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Neuffexx/DisplayKeys-IS/issues) 
I use GitHub issues to track Bugs and Tasks. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Neuffexx/DisplayKeys-IS/issues/new); it's that easy! _(Requires an account though!)_

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and examples
[This is an example](https://github.com/Neuffexx/DisplayKeys-IS/issues/26) of a real bug report that I put together as an example, which I think is informatively structured.
If any questions related to the bug arise it will be added as acomment, and all discussion around it should also be found there to keep information compiled.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can/are someone contributing to show where the issue lies (if known).
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

> People *love* thorough bug reports. Including me.


## Suggest new functionalities / features
To make any kind of suggestions please open a [new issue](https://github.com/Neuffexx/DisplayKeys-IS/issues/new) with the `suggestion` label, detailing what it is you think should be added, why, and how it should work.  
Please be descriptive but keep it digestible, and preferably (if applicable) add some visual example to make it easier to understand. (ie. if its a UI change/addition)  
If any further information is needed it will be requested within this issue.

## Discussing the current state of the code
Honestly, this is probably just developer to developer talk, and has no need to be dumped anywhere in the project unless it escalates into a new issue that needs to be worked on.  
So just contact me and/or anyone working on it directly on Discord @Neuffexx


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
That being said, if I am being honest I just do what I know without adhering to any rules, I am a sheep and just follow what PyCharm tells me is good or bad style.
